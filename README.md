# Clustering-Model

I have created a Clustering Model using PyCaret

Clustring-: It's a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields including machine learning, pattern recognition where the objects are grouped in such a way that those in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups

PyCaret -: It is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows

Clustering Model in PyCaret-: PyCaret's clustering module (pycaret.clustering) is a an unsupervised machine learning module which performs the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that those in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
